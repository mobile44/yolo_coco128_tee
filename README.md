# yolo_coco128_tee
This is a demonstration how to add a new item "Tee" into YOLO model which is pre-trained with dataset coco128.
The extra dataset "Tee" is collected from internet google search and label is prepared.
In order to match the number sequence of original dataset coco128, all "Tee" images have been renamed and labels are well prepared.
After 35 epochs, person cannot be identifed with shorted-sleeves tee.
After 300 epochs, it is doing a very good job.
